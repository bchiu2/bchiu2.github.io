            <h2>Process</h2>
              <ul>
  <li>Step 1: Concept hand drawing</li>
  <p> This was helpful to see the visualization on paper before starting.
    </p>
  <li>Step 2: Fusion360 + Illustration File</li>
  <p> I used Fusion360 to draw in real size and converted the file to dxg and opened in Illustration to change the line weight and color.
    </p>
  <li>Step 3: Laser Cut and Adjustment</li>
  <p> I laser cutted a few pieces and learned that I need to change the model to make sure it fits better. I went back to Step 2 and Step 3 two-three times.
    </p>
              </ul>

            <h2>Kit Design and Execution</h2>
                <ul>
          <li>  Design Description: My design idea came from the shape of post-its twirl. I wanted to mimic this shape.  </li>

          <li>  Execution: I sketched out the drawing and knew I need to make 2D rectangles to make 3D rectangles and stack them against each other. It was hard to put it together because I did not take into consideration of different angles. </li>
