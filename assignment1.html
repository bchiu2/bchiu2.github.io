            Who are you?
            Who is Bella Chiu? 

I am a full time first year master's student in the HCDE program. Previously, I was the design researcher at Mighty AI, a startup that provides a data management platform for autonomous vehicle perception data. I love doing research work because of the fact I can learn from users to make better products. 

In 2017, I earned my bachelorâ€™s degree in landscape architecture from Cornell University in New York. I became interested in human centered design through an industrial design course through my exchange program at the National University of Singapore. Currently, I am an active volunteer with the Interaction Design Association in Seattle. 

            Why do you want to learn about digital fabrication? 

            I am interested in digital fabrication because I am interested in 3D printing. Previously, I have done some laser cutting but we did not have a maker space so I am new to many of the fabrication machines. 

            What do you hope to learn in the class? What do you want to teach your peers?

            I hope to learn how to use the fabrication machinese in the maker space and create things! I hope to use my knowledge of laser cutting and help others.
