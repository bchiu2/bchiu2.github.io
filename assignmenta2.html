            <h2>Process</h2>
              <ul>
  <li>Step 1: Understanding Material Variables</li>
  <p> Before starting, I had to understand how having two different types of thickness ( 0.133" & 0.120" ) would affect my previous design and insertion slots.
    </p>
  <li>Step 2: Rhino + Grasshopper </li>
  <p> I used Rhino and Grasshopper to draw in 'scale' and converted the file to .ai and opened in Illustration to change the line weight and color.
    </p>
  <li>Step 3: Laser Cut</li>
  <p> I laser cutted a few pieces to made sure it fit together. Fortuntely, I had already taken into consideration the material thickness in step 1 and did not have to make any adjustments.
    </p>
              </ul>

            <h2>Kit Design and Execution</h2>
                <ul>
          <li>  Design Description: I used the same design idea as last week and made some adjustments (pattern, length, and insert slot adjustment)  </li>

          <li>  Execution: I used Rhino and Grasshopper to make multiple rectangles and moved them around. I used the array function to complete the design and baked it. It was difficult understanding how to reduce redundancy in Grasshopper.
