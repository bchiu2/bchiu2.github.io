            <h2>Process</h2>
              <ul>
  <li>Step 1: Inspiration</li>
  Understanding the requirements: An assembly of more than one part. At least one part moving. For this assignment I looked towards 3D printing mechanism as my inspiration. I found complex designs online but had to simplify my options to make sure my own design would work.  </p>

</p>
  <li>Step 2: OnShape + Dremel 3D slicer</li>
  <p> I used OnShape to draw two parts: the fan and support. In this stage I had to redraw the model two times because I originally drew in inches instead of mm. Later I assembled the pieces together with the rivet piece the class got from Joshua. I also used Dremel to slice my model to print. This part was no brainer from the last assignment.
    </p>
  <li>Step 3: 3D Printing + Assembly </li>
  <p> I ran into 3D Printing problems again. Parts of my design would not stick to the bed. I consulted with Area01 staff and they recommended I reprint. I used the broken piece to test if the rivert would fit. It does!

            <h2>Kit Design and Execution</h2>
                <ul>
          <li>  Design Description: I drew inspiration from Pin Wheels as my moving model. </li>

          <li>  Execution: I used OnShape for my CAD model and 3D Printed the pieces to attach to the rivet piece. The entire model was created in OnShape and saved as a stl file to be 3D printed. Dremel 3D slicer software was used to create the gcode.

            <p>
              I had Area01 staff help me adjust the Dremel printer. Thank you Joshua for the push-in rivets !
