            <h2>Process</h2>
              <ul>
  <li>Step 1: Materials, Dimensions, Light Source</li>
The first step for me required understanding what materials to use. Originally, I wanted to laser cut glass-plastic but due to time constraints, gave up. Later, I identify my light source and found my inspiration from images of English high tea.   </p>

</p>
  <li>Step 2: Rhino + Dremel 3D slicer</li>
  <p> I used Rhino to draw my base and used the same measurements for my illustrator file. I also used Dremel to slice my model to print.
    </p>
  <li>Step 3: 3D Printing</li>
  <p> For the first hour of 3D printing, I ran into multiple problems. One, the glue would not stick to the board. Second, orginally I drew my rhino model in inches and that did not go well in Dremel. I later created the model in mm and that worked better for Dremel.

    </p>

  <li>Step 4: Laser Cuting</li>
    <p> I laser cutted a few pieces to made sure it fit together. Fortuntely, I had already taken into consideration the material thickness in step 2 and did not have to make any adjustments.

            <h2>Kit Design and Execution</h2>
                <ul>
          <li>  Design Description: I drew inspiration from English High Tea as my model for my lamp. </li>

          <li>  Execution: I used Rhino for my base and laser cutted the pieces to attach to the base. The entire model was created in rhino and saved as a stl file to be 3D printed. Dremel 3D slicer software was used to create the gcode. The rest of the pieces were converted into an illustrator file to be laser cutted.
              I also had to change the model midway because I did not want to print out that much support. I removed one of the legs as a result.

            <p>
              I had Area01 staff help me adjust the Dremel Print Settings because my print would not stick to the board. They suggest I use tape (hence in the images you may see blue tape holding down my base)
